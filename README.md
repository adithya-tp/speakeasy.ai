## Inspiration
The inspiration behind SpeakEasy was to provide a seamless and hassle-free experience for people who are looking to book a hotel room and make restaurant reservations. The goal was to create a conversational bot that would allow users to easily make reservations over the phone without having to go through the tedious process of manually making reservations.

## What it does
SpeakEasy is a conversational bot that can be accessed over the phone. Users can call SpeakEasy to make hotel room and restaurant reservations. The bot uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand the user's requests and provide appropriate responses. It can handle various tasks such as checking availability, making reservations, and providing information about the hotel and restaurant.

## How we built it
We built SpeakEasy using several technologies. Twilio was used to handle phone calls and make voice calls. Elevenlabs was used to synthesize voice and create realistic sounding voice responses. ChatGPT/voiceflow was used to create the conversational flow of the bot and track the dialogue. Whisper was used to transcribe the receptionist's responses.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the major challenges we faced was creating a conversational flow that would be natural and easy to use for users. We also had to ensure that the bot could handle various scenarios such as when the hotel or restaurant is fully booked or if the user changes their mind about their reservation. Another challenge was making sure that the voice responses were realistic and natural-sounding.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we were able to create a working prototype of SpeakEasy that can handle various scenarios and provide a seamless experience for users. We were also able to create realistic-sounding voice responses that make the bot feel more natural and engaging.

## What we learned
During the development of SpeakEasy, we learned a lot about natural language processing and machine learning. We also learned how to integrate various technologies to create a seamless experience for users. Additionally, we learned about the importance of testing and iterating on the bot to ensure that it provides the best possible user experience.

## What's next for SpeakEasy
In the future, we plan to continue developing SpeakEasy to make it even more useful and engaging for users. We plan to integrate more advanced natural language processing techniques to make the bot more intelligent and responsive. We also plan to add more features such as the ability to book transportation and make tour reservations.
